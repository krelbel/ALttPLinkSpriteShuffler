# Format:
# destregions:
#   region: Which region to shuffle (head/body/bunny)
#     offsets: random: Choose random offsets from within the source region
#              same:   Choose the same offset from within the source region
#     sourcesprites: - List of sprite names to source from, or 'source' to only
#                      use the input .zspr file or ROM, or 'all' to use all
#                      sprites in the ./sprites/ folder
#     multisource: simple: If multiple sprites are specified in sourcesprites,
#                          pick one random sprite from sourcesprites and source
#                          all offsets from that sprite
#                  full:   If multiple sprites are specified in sourcesprites,
#                          source each offset from a different random sprite.
#     sourceregions: - List of regions to include in the pool to shuffle into
#                      this destination region.  Defaults to the same region as
#                      the destination.
